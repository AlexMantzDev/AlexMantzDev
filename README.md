## About me
My name is Alex, and I am an looking to get into the industry as a full stack developer. I have experience creating single page applications using Angular as well as using Node.js/Express in making custom REST APIs. I also am working on developing my skills with C with the goal to become more proficient in embedded programming.

I stumbled into programming after having spent a little bit of time exploring careers in computer networking and experimenting with self-hosting servers in my spare time. I enjoy all aspects of tech and am exicted for the opportunity of pursuing a career in it.

I am currently employed at Greenbrier Rail Services where I work as a Machinist operating industrial CNC mills and lathes, creating rail car components for the largest names in the rail industy.


## Interests
I have a burning passion for learning more about IOT and creating useful internet connected devices which can improve our life or workflow. I also enjoy working on Arduino projects and creating electronic circuits.
