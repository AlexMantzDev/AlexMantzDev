## About me
My name is Alex, and I am an looking to get into the industry as a full stack developer. My impetus began with a friend of mine introducing me to computer networking at the beginning of 2023 which has led me down a crazy rabbit hole which has taken my curiosity to virtual machines, self-hosting servers, setting up my own small kubernetes cluster, and eventually has led me to web development. I am passionate about learning the many facets of what allows web technologies to work. I am also facinated by digital electronics and the field of IoT.

I have been learning and honing my skills with Angular and Express.js, creating single page applications with custom APIs.

I am currently employed at Greenbrier Rail Services where I work as a CNC Machinist operating industrial mills and lathes, creating rail car components for the largest names in the rail industy.


## Interests
I have a strong desire to learn more about IoT and learning more about developing for embedded devices.
